Initial Foray:
    ✔ LIG for a single layer for single input @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ LIG for all layers for single input @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ Gradients from a single example from a single layer @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ Gradients from a single example from all layers @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ☐ Write up layer conductance paper and consider vs LIG
    ☐ Test LIG and gradients with a batch of data
    ☐ Implement cosine similarity between grads and attributions
    ☐ Do some data exploration on the gradients to devise a good compression strategy
    ☐ Run a test using glue/SST2!
