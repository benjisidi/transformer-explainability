Does it work:
    ✔ LIG for a single layer for single input @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ LIG for all layers for single input @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ Gradients from a single example from a single layer @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ Gradients from a single example from all layers @done(21-07-18 12:56)
    ✔ Test LIG and gradients with a batch of data @done(21-07-27 14:11)
    ✔ Implement cosine similarity between grads and attributions @done(21-07-27 14:11)
    ✔ Test using raw inputs not embeddings (for attention masks) @done(21-07-27 20:08)
    ✔ Implement a batch loader @started(21-07-27 14:13) @done(21-07-27 20:08) @lasted(5h55m13s)
    ✔ Get a working full run-through with layer_integrated_gradients and cos similarity @done(21-10-06 17:06)
    ✔ Run a test using glue/SST2! @done(21-10-06 17:06)
    ✔ What do -ve correlations mean? @done(21-10-08 11:50) [ These are fine. The grads can be +ve and -ve, while attr are always +ve.]
    ✔ Plot embedding score vs attribution score @done(21-10-08 11:50) [ NO CORRELATION. BUG HUNTING TIME ]
    ✔ Run for larger # of test examples, find train examples' mean similarity and # of top 10s as a sanity check @done(21-10-22 10:22)
    ☐ Code Refactor
    ☐ Add uuids to dataset and find least valuable examples
    ☐ Set up distilbert fine tuning


Is it scalable:
    ☐ LIGs are already an approximation, might not need topk
    ☐ Conductance?
    ☐ Run with larger model/dataset and see what runtimes are like


Outstanding Questions:
    ☐ Are test examples with no highly correlated training examples more frequently misclassified?
    ☐ If we remove "low-quality" training examples does this reduce performance less than a random set?
    ☐ If we remove "high-quailty" training examples does this reduce performance more than a random set?
